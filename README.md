# Batch-computer-killer
This is a batch script that I made just for fun do kill computers by deleting a file ine the EFI part of windows. This file is bootmgr and it is probably the most critical file in windows because you could kill your computer only by deleting it.

I want to precise that I am not responsable if you use this file to break you own computer or someone else 's computer.
To kill your computer, make sure to be in windows and run as administrator the anti EFI.bat file.
